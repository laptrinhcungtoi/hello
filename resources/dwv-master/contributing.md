Contributing to DWV
===================

First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute!

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to DWV,
which is hosted at https://github.com/ivmartel/dwv on GitHub.

Steps
-----
If something is not right, the first step is to submit an issue with as much detail
about your problem and your configuration. This is to make sure this behavior is not
intended (a 'feature').

The second step, for the braves, is to fork the repository and work on a fix. Don't hesitate
to ask for help, I am here for that! Once finished, you can propose a pull request. I will review
it, make comments and hopefully merge it.

License Terms
-------------
Code committed by you to this repository, whether written by you or a third party, must be
governed by the GNU General Public License (GNU GPL) version 3. By contributing Code, 
you confirm that, to the best of your knowledge, the code does not violate the
rights of any person or entity.

Not too sure what to do yet about Contributor License Agreement (CLA), I'm in between:
